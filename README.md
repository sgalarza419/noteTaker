## Installation

User must have inquirer installed.  Inquirer can be installed by typing 'npm install inquirer'.

## Usage 

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
